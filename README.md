# Pollution and Weather Analysis in Occitanie

## Project Overview
This project aims to analyze and visualize the relationship between air pollution levels and meteorological conditions in the Occitanie region. Utilizing two primary datasets - the meteorological predictions (SYNOP data) and pollution data (Atmo Occitanie), our interactive website showcases pollution levels across major cities in Occitanie, and attempts to establish a correlation with weather patterns.

### Data Sources:
- **Meteorological Prediction**: SYNOP Data
- **Pollution in Occitanie**: Atmo Occitanie Data
